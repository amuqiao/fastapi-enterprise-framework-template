The community is structured hierarchically, where model selection (Task Three) feeds into model optimization (Task Four), both of which support the classification of specific fault types such as device failure, shading, and string loss.

The classification system acts as the output layer for the AI models developed during Task Three and optimized in Task Four [Data: Entities (31), Relationships (31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 51)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Critical fault types impact system performance and maintenance planning\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Several fault types are explicitly tied to the event classification framework. Device failure indicates a complete lack of generation and signals a serious hardware or connection issue requiring urgent attention. Shading events, caused by external obstructions, reduce efficiency and are detectable through abnormal current curves in clear weather. String loss requires analysis of local PV current and MPPT data, and its detection depends on time-intensive data processing. Frequent tripping, which resembles a known image class (5), must be confirmed via real-time status checks.
