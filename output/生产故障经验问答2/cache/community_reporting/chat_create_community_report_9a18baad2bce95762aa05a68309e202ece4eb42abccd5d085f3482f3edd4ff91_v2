Its ability to retrieve detailed log data enables targeted troubleshooting, making it essential for identifying root causes of system anomalies. LTS is directly linked to Database Monitoring, indicating its role in supporting broader diagnostic workflows [Data: Entities (1), Relationships (8)]. This integration allows for deeper analysis of system behavior by correlating log entries with observed performance issues, particularly those related to database performance [Data: Relationships (8)].

Its integration with both LTS and APM underscores its central role in a multi-tool monitoring strategy aimed at system resilience [Data: Relationships (8, 9)].
