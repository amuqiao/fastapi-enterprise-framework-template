This condition typically arises when the system fails to detect the presence of a PV string, often determined through analysis of PV current and MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) data. Accurate detection of \"组串缺失\" relies heavily on local PV current measurements, and identifying such faults may require additional processing time due to the need for detailed data validation and correlation.
