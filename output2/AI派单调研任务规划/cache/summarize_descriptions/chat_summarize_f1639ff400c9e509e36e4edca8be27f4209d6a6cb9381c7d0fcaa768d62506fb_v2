This condition, identified by fault code 3 in the fault mapping system, signifies a decline in energy generation efficiency without any underlying hardware or system faults. As such, \"电站清洗\" is classified as a low-efficiency but non-critical issue that requires targeted intervention—specifically, the dispatch of a cleaning task—to restore optimal performance and maximize power output.
