The merged task now serves as the primary mechanism for validating project legitimacy in the system [Data: Entities (65), Relationships (57)].

This automated approach increases processing speed and scalability, enabling large volumes of submissions to be reviewed efficiently. However, reliance on AI introduces potential risks if model errors or training biases lead to incorrect validations. The model's direct use in the task suggests a high level of trust in automation, but also a systemic dependency that could amplify impacts if failures occur [Data: Entities (50), Relationships (60)].

This pairing is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of the registration system and preventing fraudulent submissions [Data: Entities (58, 59), Relationships (62, 63)].

This task ensured that the document issued for a project was valid and properly assigned. Although merged into the 2004 task, its core function—validating the uniqueness and correctness of the permit number—remains relevant in the unified process. The permit number serves as a unique identifier for each备案 document, and its integrity is crucial for audit trails and regulatory compliance [Data: Entities (55), Relationships (70)].
